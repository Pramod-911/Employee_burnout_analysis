### Employee_burnout_analysis
## Overview
This repository contains an analysis aimed at understanding the factors contributing to employee burnout within an organization. By examining various employee attributes, such as mental fatigue scores, resource allocation, and burn rates, the analysis seeks to identify key predictors of burnout. The ultimate goal is to develop predictive models that can quantify these relationships and provide insights for improving employee well-being.

# Methodology
# 1. Data Loading
The analysis begins with the loading of a dataset from an Excel file titled employee_burnout_analysis.xlsx. This dataset contains information on 22,750 employees, including their demographic details, work conditions, and burnout metrics.

# 2. Initial Data Exploration
An initial exploration of the dataset is conducted to understand its structure and contents. This includes examining the data types, checking for missing values, and summarizing basic statistics. The dataset consists of nine columns, including:

Employee ID
Date of Joining
Gender
Company Type
Work From Home (WFH) Setup Availability
Designation
Resource Allocation
Mental Fatigue Score
Burn Rate
# 3. Handling Missing Values
The analysis identifies missing values in key features, particularly in the "Mental Fatigue Score," "Resource Allocation," and "Burn Rate." Appropriate strategies are employed to fill in these missing values:

The "Mental Fatigue Score" is filled with a constant value of 7.1.
"Resource Allocation" is filled with 6.0.
The "Burn Rate" is filled with its mean value.
# 4. Correlation Analysis
A correlation analysis is performed to examine the relationships between numeric features and the target variable, Burn Rate. This analysis reveals strong correlations between the Burn Rate and features such as Mental Fatigue Score and Resource Allocation, indicating that these factors significantly influence employee burnout.

# 5. Encoding Categorical Variables
To prepare the data for modeling, categorical variables are encoded into numerical format using label encoding. This transformation allows the machine learning algorithms to process the data effectively.

# 6. Feature and Target Variable Preparation
The features (independent variables) and the target variable (dependent variable) are defined for modeling. The target variable is the Burn Rate, while the features include all other relevant columns, excluding the Date of Joining and Employee ID.

# 7. Data Splitting
The dataset is then split into training and testing sets, typically using 70% of the data for training and 30% for testing. This step is crucial for evaluating the performance of the predictive models.

# 8. Model Development
Three regression models are developed to predict the Burn Rate:

Linear Regression: A basic linear regression model is created to establish a relationship between the features and the Burn Rate.
Polynomial Regression: A polynomial regression model is developed to capture non-linear relationships.
Ridge Regression: A ridge regression model is implemented to address potential overfitting issues.
# 9. Model Evaluation
Each model's performance is evaluated using metrics such as Mean Squared Error (MSE) and R-squared values. The analysis reveals that the polynomial regression model generally outperforms the linear and ridge regression models in terms of MSE and R-squared values.

## Results
The analysis highlights the significant impact of mental fatigue and resource allocation on employee burnout. The polynomial regression model effectively captures the underlying patterns in the data, providing a better fit for predicting employee burnout.

## Conclusion
The Employee Burnout Analysis successfully identifies key predictors of burnout and develops predictive models to quantify these relationships. These insights can inform management strategies aimed at enhancing employee well-being and reducing burnout rates. Future work may involve exploring additional modeling techniques and conducting feature importance analysis to further refine the understanding of burnout factors.
